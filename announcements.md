# 9/23 Office Hours

I have a doctor's appointment on Tuesday, 9/23 so office hours that day will be on Zoom. If you have questions, reach out via Discord or email.

# 9/3 Office Hours

Due to the SEM Division meeting, I will not be in my office from 11-12pm on Tuesday, 9/3. I will, however, be able to answer emails during that time.

# Hopefully the Final Modification for the Semester

Because of small schedule fluctuations, I've changed the office hours a little bit. Now, I'll be in-office Monday/Wednesday 7:00-8:30 and 10:30-12:00, and Tuesday from 7am-12pm. This change has been made on the office hours page as well.

# 8/19 and 8/21 Location Modification

For the Monday and Wednesday of the first week, I will be staffing the Mathematics & Biology Welcome Table. This means that I will not be in my office, but I'm happy to chat if you would like to. The table is outside of the Math Resource Center, and I will be there from 7:30am - 8:30am and 11:00am - 12:00pm on Monday and Wednesday.
