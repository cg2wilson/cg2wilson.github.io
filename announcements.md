# 8/19 and 8/21 Location Modification
For the Monday and Wednesday of the first week, I will be staffing the Mathematics & Biology Welcome Table. This means that I will not be in my office, but I'm happy to chat if you would like to. The table is outside of the Math Resource Center, and I will be there from 7:30am - 8:30am and 11:00am - 12:00pm on Monday and Wednesday.
