The second part of this chapter discusses the theories of Vygotsky. Schunk, citing Tudge & Scrimsher (2003), notes that Vygotsky's theories place "more emphasis on the social environment as a facilitator of development and learning" than does Piaget ("Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory", para. 1). His initial contention was that "unlike animals, which react only to the environment, humans have the adaptive capacity to alter the environment for their own purposes"; this aligned with his Marxist political leanings ("Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory", Background, para. 3-4). Vygotsky "moved from a Pavlovian view of psychology focusing on reflexes to a cultural-historical perspective that stressed language and social interaction (Tudge & Scrimsher 2003)" (para. 5). 


Vygotsky's approach emphasized "softer" factors than Piaget with regard to how humans develop. Three items are marked to stand out: 
- Interpersonal/social factors ("students transform their [interpersonal/social] experiences based on their knowledge and characteristics and reorganize their mental structures" ())
- Cultural-historical factors
- Individual factors
