### My Story
My undergraduate education began at the University of Central Oklahoma, but detoured to Tulsa Community College. I earned my B.S. in Mathematics and B.S. in Education at the University of Tulsa in May 2011, with a focus on teaching high school level mathematics. I received my M.S. in Applied Mathematics in 2013 at TU as well, and my M.A. in Mathematics from OU in 2017.


I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at Oklahoma State University, under Dr. John Paul Cook.


I'm a certified teacher by the State of Oklahoma, holding the following certifications:
- Advanced Mathematics (Grades 6-12)
- Intermediate Mathematics (Grades 6-12)
- Mid-Level Math for High School Credit (Grades 5-8)
- Speech/Drama/Debate


### Miscellaneous
Prior to my OU, I was the Assistant Speech & Debate Coach at Union Public Schools. I have been involved with the Speeech & Debate community since high school, with various levels of investment. In addition to Union, I coached policy debate at Bishop Kelley High School (my alma mater). I do occasionally judge at or help with running local tournaments.


I use he/him pronouns, but I'm not picky.
