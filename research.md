### General Interests

I am beginning my research career, but am interested in 
- How students learn and interact with calculus
- Mathematical creativity
- Student understanding of equivalence between contexts, particularly for abstract algebra and measurement
- Vertical transfer issues for students transitioning from two-year to four-year institutions, particularly credit loss
