### General Interests

I am beginning my research career, but am interested in

- How students learn and interact with calculus
- Mathematical creativity
- Student understanding of equivalence between contexts, particularly for abstract algebra and measurement
- Vertical transfer issues for students transitioning from two-year to four-year institutions, particularly credit loss
- Alternative grading methods, particularly standards-based grading
