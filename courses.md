## OCCC
I began adjuncting at OCCC in the Summer of 2015, and continued to do so almost every semester until I got hired full-time in August 2023. I enjoy the close-knit community, small class sizes, and dedication to the teaching mission that can be found here.

### This Semester

In the Fall of 2024, I'll be teaching the following courses:
- Math 1473: Functions & Modeling
- Math 2013: Introduction to Statistics
- Math 2104: Calculus & Analytic Geometry I
